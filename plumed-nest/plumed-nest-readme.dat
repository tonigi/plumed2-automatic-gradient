ENDPLUMED

This is a placeholder file. This PLUMED-NEST entry provides code
illustrating two approaches to automate gradient computation for
collective variables in PLUMED. The input files in this repository
exercise the example CVs (namely, CURVATURE_CODEGEN,
CURVATURE_AUTODIFF, and CURVATURE_MULTICOLVAR_CODEGEN) implemented in
https://github.com/tonigi/plumed2-automatic-gradients.git and not
found in the "official" PLUMED distribution.
 
Please refer to the above repository and paper for full instructions.
