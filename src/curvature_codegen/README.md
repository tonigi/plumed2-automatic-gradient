Computer-algebra system code generation approach for collective variables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Toni Giorgino


This directory shows how to use [SymPy](http://sympy.org) to
automatically generate source code for collective variables and their
gradients from symbolic expressions.  Code generation is the first
approach described in the companion paper (see citation).  The code
can be copied, modified and used as a template.
