Automatic reverse-mode differentiation approach for collective variables
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Toni Giorgino


This directory shows how to use the [Stan Math
library](http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/math) to implement
auto-differentiating collective variable functions.  Automatic
reverse-mode code differentiation is the second approach described in
the companion paper (see citation).  The code can be copied, modified
and used as a template.

Note that the Stan Math library is included here as a git
submodule. Make sure you have submodules enabled. The easiest way is
to use the `git clone --recursive` when you first clone PLUMED2's
repository.
